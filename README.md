# LernaLang

## Project Description
LernaLang is a language learning mobile application built with React Native, Firebase and OpenAI API. This application gives users a chance to practice speaking
and writing in a foreign language more often. This app is particularly useful if a user doesn't have access to people that speak the language or are a little
shy about looking silly practicing a foreign language. 

## Tech Stack & APIs
- React Native
- Firebase
- OpenAI API

## Getting Started
1. Clone repo - `git clone https://github.com/Kmukasa/LernaLang.git`
2. Install dependencies - `npm i`
3. You'll have to use your own API keys from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
4. Run the client server - `npm run start`
5. Run the server - `npm run dev`

### Running Storybook
1. Comment out the code in App.js and uncomment the line `// export { default } from "./.storybook";`
2. Run `npm run storybook-generate` stories and then run `npm run storybook-watch`
3. Run the client server - `npm run start`
4. Remember to uncomment the app and comment out the export line of storybook if you want to run the app normally

## Personal reason for building this app
I've been "working" on a language learning application for a long time now but haven't had the resources, knowledge or skills to complete it till now. 
This application came from a place of embarrassment regarding my own monolinguisim and fear of looking stupid whilst learning something new. 
I've seen how the best way to master a skill is through repetition, so I decided to build this application to practice language learning more often and 
also code more. With the renaissance of AI applications I realized that building this application would be easier than ever. I've also been really interested
in this new wave of AI technology and was excited about the idea of using it in my own life. 
If you've found youself on this page, know that it is with great joy and grit that this application has come to life. If you have any 
questions or would like to contribute, I'd be happy to chat!
